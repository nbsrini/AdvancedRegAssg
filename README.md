## General Information
Problem Statement & Objective:
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
How well those variables describe the price of a house.
We are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not. This will be an advanced regression model using Ridge and Lasso techniques for house price prediction.

We are also required to determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

Steps for the model are below:
S1:Data Understanding and Data Loading
S2:Data pre-processing (Missing values, Outliers, categorical values)
S3:EDA (Univariate, Bivariate and /or Multivariate analysis)
S4:Model Building
S5:Evaluation : Model choice / key observations
S6:Subjective Questions

## Conclusions
We have developed advanced regression models (Ridge and Lasso) to predict house prices.

The summary of model performance/comparison is evaluated as follows

Ridge regression:
The optimal alpha value for ridge is 50.000000
ridge  Regression with  50
===================================
R2 score (train) :  0.9020496865615709
R2 score (test) :  0.8759022434812159
RMSE (train) :  0.12525145087376433
RMSE (test) :  0.13998244238107563

Lasso regression:
The optimal alpha value for lasso is 0.001000
lasso  Regression with  0.001
===================================
R2 score (train) :  0.9021510515706596
R2 score (test) :  0.8774506498742309
RMSE (train) :  0.12518662514533568
